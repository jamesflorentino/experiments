This repository contains a list of my adventures in learning starting from Dec 1, 2012.

Some of the stuff may or may not work. You are free to check them out but keep note that I will not be responsible for any loss you might encounter if ever you decide to use one of my work for actual production.

Nonetheless, contribution or code suggestion is highly appreciated.
